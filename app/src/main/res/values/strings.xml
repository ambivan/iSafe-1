    <string name="iSafe">The National Safer India Challenge comes with the\nvision to ignite the competitive spirit of the youth to\nachieve path breaking changes in the field of road \nsafety. We want to do this by enabling the youth\n and providing them a platform to do, what they like \nto do and in the process, create sustainable impact.\n\n\nThus, the Safer India Challenge\' 17 provides the \ncollege to choose the domain they have\nan expertise on, domain consisting of activities that\n require the specific skill they possess, so that we\n can create overall impact on the field of road safety\n across technology, law, health and awareness.\n\nThe colleges have been provided a large number\n of activities under their domains in various sub-\nsections from which they can chose on the activity\n they like and perform those over 8 months.\n\nNot only the domains have activities concerning\n the specific skill sets but they also come in with the\n benefits for these students in particular which\n would help them in their future pursuits.\n</string>

    <string name="check1">CHECKLIST 1 - STAGE 1 AUDIT (DURING FEASIBILITY STUDY)</string>
    <string name="q1"> What is the category of road for which the feasibility study has been carried out e.g.,
      expressway, national highway, state highway or other roads?
    </string>
    <string name="q2">Is the road intended to carry high-speed traffic or serve local access needs only?</string>
    <string name="q3">What kind of traffic is likely ranging from high speed mixed traffic or for more general
    use, including bicycles and significant pedestrian traffic?</string>
    <string name="q4">Do the chosen type of road and the standards,\n alignment and cross-section offer
    optimum road\n safety to all groups of road user including\n disabled in combination with
    the\n expected traffic density and speeds?</string>
    <string name="q5"> Will the proposed scheme be compatible\n with the standard of conjoining road
    sections?</string>
    <string name="q6"> Will there be sufficient opportunities for overtaking?</string>
    <string name="q7">Are the number and distribution of intersections appropriate in relation to:
    a) The desired function of the new road?
    b) Impact on the surrounding, adjacent and/or off-loaded road network (does the
    project simply move present problems?)?\n
    c) Accessibility for public transport and emergency vehicles?</string>
    <string name="q8"> Are the proposed horizontal and vertical\n alignments consistent with visibility
    requirements\n both along the road and junctions?</string>
    <string name="q9"> Has lighting been planned? If so, does the \nlighting offer maximum safety, both on\n links
    and at junctions?</string>
    <string name="q10">Will the project have any effect on existing pedestrian\n and cycle routes?</string>
    <string name="q11">Does the project include measures for\n vulnerable road-users and if so, do\n these
    measures offer maximum safety?\n Do the available accident data for the existing/adjacent\n road network give reason to
    expect particular\n road safety problems in the proposed project?</string>
    <string name="q12"> Whether non-motorised traffic is expected\n to cause problems?</string>
    <string name="q13">What is the likelihood of future widening?</string>
    <string name="q14"> Check any special events creating unusual or hazardous conditions and any other
    matter, which may have a bearing on safety.</string>

    <string name="check2">CHECKLIST 2 - STAGE 2 AUDIT (COMPLETION OF PRELIMINARY DESIGN)</string>
    <string name="q15">Is the desired speed compatible with the cross-section and other design elements
     and is the desired speed realistic?
   </string>


    <string name="q16">Is there adequate space for all groups of road users ?</string>
    <string name="q17">Is there appropriate separation between various groups of road users?</string>
    <string name="q18">Do the proposed alignment satisfy any demands on visibility at junctions and
    sight distances on free sections?</string>
    <string name="q19"> Will sight distances/visibility be blocked by traffic signs, guardrails, bridge
    parapets, buildings, rigid obstacles or plantations (now and in the future)</string>
    <string name="q20">Junctions, interchanges and their design:
    a) Will road users coming from all directions (including side roads) be able to see
    that they are approaching a conflict area? Are give-way lines, stop lines,
    turning lanes and ramps clearly visible?
    b) Are existing conjoining and intersecting roads appropriately adjusted and
    matched to the new road (without sharp bends and gradients)?
    c) Do the routes of road users through the junction seem clear for all directions
    and manoeuvres?
    d) Is there sufficient space for all types of vehicles to undertake all manoeuvres?
    e) Are the crossing facilities for pedestrians and non-motorised traffic adequate
    and safe?
    f) Can parking cause problems?
    g) Have roundabouts been considered?

    In urban areas, ghost markings and left-turning lanes with islands are safest; they
    prevent overtaking and assist pedestrians and cyclists who are crossing the road.
</string>
    <string name="q21">Decide whether or not old, unremoved section of road can give undesired optical
    directions.</string>
    <string name="q22">Special points at roundabouts:
    a)  Are all entrance lanes curved and is speed adequately reduced?
    b)  Will the central island be visible?
    c)  Are the measures taken for the benefit of pedestrians from a safe stopping
    distance and cycle traffic adequate?</string>
    <string name="q23"> Are existing junctions and intersections adjusted and matched to the new road
    appropriately (without sharp bends and gradients)?</string>
    <string name="q24">Are there any constructions that will be difficult to drain ?</string>
    <string name="q25">Will overtaking be prevented at critical places (not simply by restrictions, but also by
    making it quite apparent that overtaking is prohibited)?</string>





    <string name="q26">If signs and road markings have been proposed:
    a) Are the markings consistent and are they adequate?
    b) Has the quantity of information been kept at a reasonable level?</string>
    <string name="q27">If markings have not been proposed: will special markings be necessary?</string>
    <string name="q28">Is there any risk that cannot be "marked out of existence"?</string>
    <string name="q29"> Will there be any large sign constructions? Is so; will guardrails or breakaway safety
    devices protect them?</string>
    <string name="q30"> Has it been proposed that lighting be located on the outside or inside of bends?</string>
    <string name="q31">Will it be possible to carry out maintenance work (on lighting, gantries, plantations,
    etc.) safely and without using the carriageway or cycle path?</string>
    <string name="q32">Is the landscaping design or plantation likely to lead to a lowering of safety with mature
    or seasonal growth? Is frangible vegetation appropriate?</string>
    <string name="q33"> Are there arrangements for safe access by emergency vehicles? Check the design of
    medians and barriers, and the ability of emergency vehicles to stop without
    necessarily disrupting traffic?</string>
    <string name="q34">  Pedestrians
    a) Have pedestrian needs been considered?
    b) If footpaths are not specifically provided, is the road layout safe for use by
    pedestrians, particularly at blind corners and on bridges?

    d) Is the avoidance of footbridges or subways possible by crossing the road at
    grade?
    e) Has specific provision been made for pedestrian crossings, school crossings
    or pedestrian signals?
    f) Are pedestrian refuges/kerb extensions needed?
    g) Whether needs of disabled road users taken care of?</string>
    <string name="q35"> Have the needs of public transport users been considered? Are bus stops positioned
    for safety?</string>
    <string name="q36">Is lighting envisaged in specified locations of the project? Are the difficulties of
    illuminating sections of the road caused by trees or over bridges, for example? Are
    there any aspects of the provision of the lighting poles, which would require
    consideration from the safety point of view in their being struck by vehicles?</string>
    <string name="q37"> Is adequate safe access to the work site available?</string>
    <string name="q38"> Are there any factors requiring specific road safety provision, including maintenance?</string>
    <string name="q39">Are there any traffic management features, which would require special attention
    during construction or during the transition from construction to full operation?</string>
